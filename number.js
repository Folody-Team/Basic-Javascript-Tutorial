//In this file we will learn about some of the basic type of javascript number variable type:

const num = 1 // Number without decimals
const num2 = 2.2 //Number with decimals
const num3 = 3e5 //Large number

//NOTE: IF YOU DECLARE THE NUMBER LIKE THIS :
let number = "3";
//Javascript will see it as a string
//A number cannot be in a quote
