//In this file we learn how to create javascript function:

//JavaScript functions are defined with the function keyword.

function Name(parameters) {
  // code to be executed
}

//example:
function family(){
  const familyMembers = ["mother" , "father" , "brother" , "sister"]
}

//And this is how you call a javascript function:

functionName():

//example:

family():
//This will return mother,father,brother,sister in the console
